## FAQ

- When i try to update youtube-dl with ``youtube-dl -U``, i obtain the following message in my debian/ubuntu

```
It looks like you installed youtube-dl with a package manager, pip, setup.py or a tarball. Please use that to update.
```

instead of 

```
youtube-dl: error: youtube-dl's self-update mechanism is disabled on Debian.
Please update youtube-dl using apt(8).
See https://packages.debian.org/sid/youtube-dl for the latest packaged version.
```

No panic : you have just downloaded a newer version of youtube-dl who is not in apt. When a new version of youtube-dl will be released in apt, you will download it automatically with ``sudo apt upgrade``. If you want to retrieve the previous version, ``sudo apt remove youtube-dl && sudo apt install youtube-dl``

- I would like a MP3 format but i obtain an OGG format, why?

The ``ffmpeg`` package is required for the MP3 conversion. Install it and retry to launch ytdlmusic

- The commands indicated in this README don't work! Why?

The  syntax of the commands can be change between versions, run ``ytdlmusic`` and read the help message. 

- I obtain the error about ``_requesthandler.py line 22`` when I try to use ytdlmusic

Sorry... You should update python to 3.6 version or more. youtube-search-python seems not to be compatible with python 3.5 and less. In the version 0.6.1 and more, the ytdlmusic package check the python version at the installation process.

- What are the compatibility with Python, pip, youtube-dl and youtube-search-python?

When a new version of ytdlmusic is published, it is tested with the last versions of pip, youtube-dl and youtube-search-python. For Python, the last versions are too tested in the branches 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10. Each night, a job retest the actual package with last versions of dependencies and Pythons 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10. These tests are played with GitHub Actions on an Ubuntu 18.04 image.
## thanks

This package use two very important dependencies :
- [youtube_dl](https://pypi.org/project/youtube_dl/)
- [youtube-search-python](https://pypi.org/project/youtube-search-python/)
