## FAQ

### When i try to update youtube-dl with ``youtube-dl -U``, i obtain an error message in my debian/ubuntu

If you obtain the following message : 

```
It looks like you installed youtube-dl with a package manager, pip, setup.py or a tarball. Please use that to update.
```

instead of 

```
youtube-dl: error: youtube-dl's self-update mechanism is disabled on Debian.
Please update youtube-dl using apt(8).
See https://packages.debian.org/sid/youtube-dl for the latest packaged version.
```

, no panic! You have just downloaded a newer version of youtube-dl which is not in apt. When a new version of youtube-dl will be released in apt, you will download it automatically with ``sudo apt upgrade``. If you want to retrieve the previous version, ``sudo apt remove youtube-dl && sudo apt install youtube-dl``

### I would like a MP3 format but I only get an OGG format, why?

The ``ffmpeg`` package is required for the MP3 conversion. Install it and retry to launch ytdlmusic

### The commands indicated in this README don't work for me! Why?

The  syntax of the commands can be change between versions, run ``ytdlmusic`` and read the help message. 

### I get an error about ``_requesthandler.py line 22`` when I try to use ytdlmusic

Sorry... You should update Python to 3.6 version or more. youtube-search-python doesn't seems to be compatible with Python 3.5 or less. Now, ytdlmusic package checks the Python version during the installation process.

### What are the compatibilities with Python, pip, youtube-dl and youtube-search-python?

When an new version is released, it is compatible with the last Python version ine the branches 3.6 to 3.9, on the release date. It's also compatible with the last versions of dependencies, on the release date.

### Have you tested your package?

Before a new version of ytdlmusic is published, it is checked in an [automatic job](https://github.com/thib1984/ytdlmusic/actions/workflows/release.yml), with the last versions of pip, youtube-dl and youtube-search-python, and too in the last versions of Python in the four branches 3.6 to 3.9. 

Each night, [another automatic job](https://github.com/thib1984/ytdlmusic/actions/workflows/test_published.yml) checks the actual package with last versions of dependencies and Pythons 3.6 to 3.9 and 3.10. So if a regression appears, the author of ytdlmusic received  an automatic mail to warn it.

These tests are executed with GitHub Actions on an Ubuntu 18.04 image.
