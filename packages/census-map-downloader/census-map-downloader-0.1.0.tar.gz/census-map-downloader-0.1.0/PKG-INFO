        You can specify the download directory with --data-dir ::
        
            $ censusmapdownloader --data-dir ./my-special-folder/ counties
        
        Contributing
        ------------
        
        Install dependencies for development ::
        
            $ pipenv install --dev
        
        Run tests ::
        
            $ make test
        
        Ship new version to PyPI ::
        
            $ make ship
        
        Adding additional years to a dataset
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Downloader classes for different geography types are defined in modules of :code:`census_map_downloader.geotypes`. For example, the downloader for counties is :code:`census_map_downloader.geotypes.counties.CountiesDownloader`.
        
        If the URL and fields in a shapefile are the same as those for years that are already supported, you can just add the year to the :code:`YEAR_LIST` attribute.
        
        If the fields are the same, but the URL changes between groups of years, add logic to the :code:`url` property method of the downloader classes to alter the URL based on :code:`self.year`.
        
        If the fields and URL change from year to year, consider creating classes for each year and delegating to :code:`census_map_downloader.geotypes.tracts.TractsDownloader` is an example of a class that uses this approach.
        
        Developing the CLI
        ------------------
        
        The command-line interface is implemented using Click and setuptools. To install it locally for development inside your virtual environment, run the following installation command, as `prescribed by the Click documentation <https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/setuptools/#setuptools-integration>`_. ::
        
            $ pip install --editable .
