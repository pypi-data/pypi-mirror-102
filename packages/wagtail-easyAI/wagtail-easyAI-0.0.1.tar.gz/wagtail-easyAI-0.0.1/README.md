# Overview
**EasyAI** is a user interface that acts like a drag and drop machine learning software. It allows the user to input their data and the program takes over for them by using the best, most accurate machine learning algorithm. This removes the middle ground and allows the researcher to focus on collecting, and interpreting the data rather than figuring out the best algorithm to use. **EasyAI** also gives the user the option of visualizing the data through different charts and graphs. The best part is that they are formatted in a professional way so that they can be used **immediately**.
