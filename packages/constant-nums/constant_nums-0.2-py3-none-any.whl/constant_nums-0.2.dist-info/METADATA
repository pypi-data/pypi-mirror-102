# Constant
Whenever I think about to make that thing (intenger,float, dataframe , array) constant. it works mostly on all the languages but not in python. So, I decided to create a package for constant numbers like pi and etc. That should be easy. So, here it is.
#### How to use it!
First install library - **pip install constant_nums**
after that, **from constant_nums import final**
basic syntax should be like this only 
 **<constant_name> = final.cons(<unit>,<constant_name>)**
 Now here unit means anything, like int,str,dataframe and array anything. The name of the constant should be same in both the sides. Otherwise it won't a constant anymore.
Example : **pi = final.cons(3.14, "pi")** and voila it works.
