    'long_description': '# Sweetheart **0.1.1**\n*do better with low-code and low-costs python programs*\n\n## A supercharged heart for the non-expert hands\n\nSince Ubuntu 20.04 can be installed as usual softwares within Windows 10, it provides an incredible way for any organization to develop, deploy, and administrate **powerful responsive web-apps including AI** on its own local network keeping high capabilities of integration with the already existing tools like databases, MS-Excel, and SAP.\n\nSweetheart provides a simple Python/Html centric approach leading you implementing best components and best coding practices. Due to the top-rated place of the Python language regarding to data processing, calculations and AI, this makes sweetheart a fast and ideal toolkit to e-volute towards **Industry4.0** precepts and innovative ideas.\n\nSweetheart is shared under the [CeCILL-C FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT](https://github.com/IncredibleProgress/sweetheart.py/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n## Get coding full power including AI at the light speed\n\nSweetheart supports you getting coding full power from scratch:\n\n- easy to learn, easy to use\n- full documentation provided\n- built-in responsive user interfaces\n- quick and clean prototyping\n- quick and clean deployment\n- ready for maintenable great code quality\n- ready for datacenters, big-data and AI\n- ready for high performances, innovation and creativity\n\n## Stick to good standards without thinking about it\n\nSweetheart is a thin-layer for going efficient and doesn\'t reinvent the wheel. It just intends to transform you stepwise in a good driver and maybe in a pilot! Due to provided components, configuration and documentation **you will learn quickly to make great python/html code** including up-to-date best practices and patterns. You won\'t learn Sweetheart itself, you will learn Python/Html real programming life like any other developer, but gradually and under control.

In a second time you will take benefits of Sweetheart as a convenient super-orchestrator for low-costs.\n\n## Keep permanently innovative capabilities\n\nThe following *sweetheart development chart* allows to evaluate coding and costs efforts for implementation of most important and innovative features at the date of today.\n\n|                                              | Coding effort | Costs effort |\n| :------------------------------------------- | :-----------: | :----------: |\n| Build responsive webapp with default libs    | FAST          | FREE         |\n| Build responsive datavisualizations          | MIDDLE        | FREE         |\n| Run MongoDB/webserver on local network       | FAST          | FREE         |\n| Improve code quality and reinforce security  | EXPERT        | CHEAP        |\n| Run MongoDB/webserver as internet services   | MIDDLE        | MODERATE     |\n| Implement AI capabilities                    | MIDDLE        | MODERATE     |\n| Implement SAP gateway                        | MIDDLE        | MODERATE     |\n| Erect and run a dedicated datacenter         | EXPERT        | HIGH         |\n\n## Code examples\n\n### your first webpage controller written in Python\n\n``` python\nfrom sweetheart.sweet import quickstart\nfrom sweetheart.heart import Route, HTMLResponse\n\nquickstart( Route("/", HTMLResponse("<h1>Welcome!</h1>")) )\n```\n\n### your first *sweet* Html webpage\n\n``` html\n%rebase("HTML")\n\n<div style="text-align:center;">\n  <h1>Welcome!</h1>\n  <p>get coding full power at the light speed now</p>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Install and run Sweetheart\n\n### set WSL on Windows 10\n\nDiscovering what is the WSL, have a look at the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about). Then install *Ubuntu 20.04* via the Windows Store. At this step installing *VS Code* and *Windows Terminal* can be recommended to you too. When done click on Ubuntu within start menu, and now *Bash* is running!\n\n### first steps with Bash\n\n``` bash\n# set prerequisites\ncurl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncredibleProgress/sweetheart.py/master/get-sweetheart.py | python3 -\n\n# then restart bash and get initial components\nbash sws sweet --init\n\n# at last run sweetheart enabling JupyterLab \nsws start --jupyter-lab\n```\n\nThere is here no heavy installation process which could badly interact with the operating system. Everything goes and runs safely within dedicated */home* directories. [Click-here]() for detailed informations.\n\n### get power with many additionnal resources\n\n``` bash\n# interested for calculation, machine-learning, ms-excel\nsws install science\n\n# interested for processing or scraping the web\nsws install web\n```\n\n## Epilogue: a new life starts now\n\nEven at this Beta-stage, Sweetheart allows you to make a lot by yourself. Enjoy discovering and learning how coding can help and support you, using amazing raw materials widely used by GAFAM and others!\n',
