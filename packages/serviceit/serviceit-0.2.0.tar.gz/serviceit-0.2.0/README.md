Turn any Python function into a service that receives JSON payloads on some port.

Hereâ€™s a trivial example:

```python
import serviceit
def receiver(payload):
    print(payload)
server = serviceit.server(1533, receiver)
# Now it will receive JSON on 1533. For convenience:
server.client().send(dict(message="hi"))
print(server.bytes_processed)
```

#### More complex example: isolate code
You can use this to isolate a component of you code.
For example, rdkit can be installed through Conda but not Pip (or Poetry).
So, create a service and import it in an Anaconda environment to create a server,
and in your pip-installed client code.

**In a Conda environment**, create a service that listens on port 1533:

```python
import serviceit

def _receiver(payload):
    # noinspection PyUnresolvedReferences
    from rdkit.Chem.inchi import InchiToInchiKey
    inchikey = InchiToInchiKey(payload["inchi"])
    print(inchikey)

server = serviceit.server(1533, _receiver)
```

**On your pip-install client side:**

```python
import serviceit
client = serviceit.client(1533)
client.send(dict(inchi="InChI=1S/H2O/h1H2"))
```
