## ProcessOptimizer

ProcessOptimizer is a fork of scikit-optimize. ProcessOptimizer will fundamentally function like scikit-optimize, 
yet developments are focussed on bringing improvements to help optimizing real world processes, like chemistry or baking.
For examples on use, checkout https://github.com/novonordisk-research/ProcessOptimizer/tree/develop/examples.

## Installation

ProcessOptimizer can be installed using `pip install ProcessOptimizer`
The repository and examples can be found at https://github.com/novonordisk-research/ProcessOptimizer
ProcessOptimizer can also be installed by running `pip install -e .` in top directory of the cloned repository.

## Contributions

Feel free to play around with algorithm. Should you encounter errors while using ProcessOptimizer, please report them
at https://github.com/novonordisk-research/ProcessOptimizer/issues. <br>
To help solve the issues, please: <br>

- Provide minimal amount of code to reproduce the error
- State versions of ProcesOptimizer, sklearn, numpy, ...
- Describe the expected nehavior of the code <br>

If you would like to contribute by making anything from documentation to feature-additions, THANK YOU. Please open a pull request 
marked as *WIP* as early as possible and describe the issue you seek to solve and outline your planned solution.

## Related work

We are currently building a GUI to offer the power of Bayesian Process Optimization to non-coders. Stay tuned.

## PyPi

If you have not packaged before check out https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/
To upload a new version to PyPi do the following in the root folder of the project:

- In terminal run the command "pytest" and make sure there are no errors
- Change version number in setup.py
- Change version number in ProcessOptimizer/\_\_init\_\_.py
- Remember to `pip install twine` if running in a new virtual env
- Run `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`
- Run `python -m twine upload dist/*` (make sure that /dist only contains relevant version)
