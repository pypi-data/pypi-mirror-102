### Bundler
This repository is based on the [OpenAPI specification](
https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md) which is a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs. 

> The `Bundler` python class attempts to bundle individual yaml files into a single file, post process extensions and validate the bundled openapi.yaml file.
