Description: # Hierarch
        
        ## A Hierarchical Resampling Package for Python
        
        Version 0.1
        
        Hierarch is a package for hierarchical resampling (bootstrapping, permutation, jackknifing) datasets in Python. Because for loops are ultimately intrinsinc to cluster-aware resampling, Hierarch uses Numba to accelerate many of its key functions.
        
        Hierarch has several functions for performing resampling-based hypothesis tests on hierarchical data. Additionally, Hierarch can be used to construct power analyses for hierarchical experimental designs. 
        
        ### Dependencies
        * numpy
        * numba
        * scipy (for power analysis)
        * sympy (for jackknifing)
