Description: # GREECE (Geographic REnewable Energy Candidate Extraction) model
        
        GREECE is a pre-processing model used to extract geographical candidate sites for further selection of optimal RE sites (location and size) using combinatorial optimization.
        
        
        ## Introduction
        
        GREECE processes various geographic layers (areas, networks, terrain, resource) with respect to various range control parameters (buffer, threshold, surface area).
        It is composed of several sub-models, at the moment for solar GHI synthetic generation, PV conversion, or else road transportation.
        The model is written in Python and the interface is made through configuration files and Shell scripts.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The easiest way to install greece is through Pypi. In your preferred virtual environment, just type in:
        
        ``$ pip install greece``
        
        
        ## TODO
        Here's the list of what is done and what remains to be done:
        - [x] Constraint model
        - [x] Solar GHI model
        - [x] PV conversion model
        - [x] Biomass model
        - [ ] Hydro model
        - [ ] Wind model
        - [ ] Storage model
        - [ ] Terrain-based effects on solar radiation (horizon obstruction + altitude)
        - [ ] PostgreSQL interface for input data
        - [ ] Power Flow model for further analysis of network voltage stability
        - [ ] Link to CPLEX optimization within Python (through [``cplex``](https://pypi.org/project/cplex/) or [``pyomo``](http://www.pyomo.org/))
        
        
        
        ## How to use
        First, add "/greece/rentools/shell_scripts" directory to your global path (using ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile files).
        Make all python scripts executable, e.g.:
        
        ``$ sudo chmod +x solar_ghi.py``
        
        Then, build configuration directory ("greece_%s_config" with %s={'solar', 'pv', 'biomass'}) for your problem such as:
        
        ``$ build_config.py --type solar /path/to/dir/where/config/must/be/stored``
        
        Fill corresponding config files. Finally, you can call the script corresponding to the model you want to run. Typical usage is:
        
        ``$ solar_ghi.py path/to/corresponding/config/folder``
