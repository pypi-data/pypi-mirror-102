Democritus functions<sup>[1]</sup> for working with network requests.

[1] Democritus functions are <i>simple, effective, modular, well-tested, and well-documented</i> Python functions.

We use `d8s` as an abbreviation for `democritus` (you can read more about this [here](https://github.com/democritus-project/roadmap#what-is-d8s)).

## Functions

  - ```python
    def requests_basic_auth(user, password):
        """Return an instance of request's basic auth."""
    ```
  - ```python
    def get(
        url,
        *,
        use_common_user_agent: bool = True,
        process_response: bool = False,
        process_response_as_bytes: bool = False,
        **request_kwargs,
    ):
        """Make a GET request to the given URL."""
    ```
  - ```python
    def head(url, *, process_response: bool = False, **kwargs):
        """Make a head request."""
    ```
  - ```python
    def post(
        url,
        *,
        update_headers_for_datatype: bool = True,
        process_response: bool = False,
        process_response_as_bytes: bool = False,
        **request_kwargs,
    ):
        """Make a POST request to the given URL with the given data."""
    ```
  - ```python
    def headers_update(headers: Dict[str, str], new_header_key: str, new_header_value: Any, *, overwrite: bool = True):
        """."""
    ```
  - ```python
    def put(
        url,
        *,
        update_headers_for_datatype: bool = True,
        process_response: bool = False,
        process_response_as_bytes: bool = False,
        **request_kwargs,
    ):
        """Make a PUT request to the given URL with the given data."""
    ```
  - ```python
    def delete(
        url,
        *,
        process_response: bool = False,
        process_response_as_bytes: bool = False,
        **request_kwargs,
    ):
        """Make a DELETE request to the given URL with the given data."""
    ```
  - ```python
    def url_hash(url, hash_type='sha256'):
        """Return the hash of the url."""
    ```
  - ```python
    def urllib3_backoff_factor_executions(backoff_factor: float, number_of_requests: int):
        """Return the times (in seconds) of the first n requests with the given backoff_factor. See https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/index.html#urllib3.Retry under the "backoff_factor" argument."""
    ```
