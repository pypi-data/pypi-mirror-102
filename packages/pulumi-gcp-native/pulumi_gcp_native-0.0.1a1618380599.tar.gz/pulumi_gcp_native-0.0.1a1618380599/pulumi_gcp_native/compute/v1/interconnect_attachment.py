If not specified, the value will default to AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN_ANY.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] encryption: Indicates the user-supplied encryption option of this interconnect attachment: 
               - NONE is the default value, which means that the attachment carries unencrypted traffic. VMs can send traffic to, or receive traffic from, this type of attachment. 
               - IPSEC indicates that the attachment carries only traffic encrypted by an IPsec device such as an HA VPN gateway. VMs cannot directly send traffic to, or receive traffic from, such an attachment. To use IPsec-encrypted Cloud Interconnect, create the attachment using this option. 
               Not currently available in all Interconnect locations.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] google_reference_id: [Output Only] Google reference ID, to be used when raising support tickets with Google or otherwise to debug backend connectivity issues. [Deprecated] This field is not used.

The addresses must be RFC 1918 IP address ranges. When creating HA VPN gateway over the interconnect attachment, if the attachment is configured to use an RFC 1918 IP address, then the VPN gateway?s IP address will be allocated from the IP address range specified here. For example, if the HA VPN gateway?s interface 0 is paired to this interconnect attachment, then an RFC 1918 IP address for the VPN gateway interface 0 will be allocated from the IP address specified for this interconnect attachment. If this field is not specified for interconnect attachment that has encryption option as IPSEC, later on when creating HA VPN gateway on this interconnect attachment, the HA VPN gateway's IP address will be allocated from regional external IP address pool.
               Not currently available in all Interconnect locations.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#interconnectAttachment for interconnect attachments.

               - OS_ACTIVE: The attachment has been turned up and is ready to use. 
               - OS_UNPROVISIONED: The attachment is not ready to use yet, because turnup is not complete.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] pairing_key: [Output only for type PARTNER. Input only for PARTNER_PROVIDER. Not present for DEDICATED]. The opaque identifier of an PARTNER attachment used to initiate provisioning with a selected partner. Of the form "XXXXX/region/domain"
        :param pulumi.Input[str] partner_asn: Optional BGP ASN for the router supplied by a Layer 3 Partner if they configured BGP on behalf of the customer. Output only for PARTNER type, input only for PARTNER_PROVIDER, not available for DEDICATED.

The InterconnectAttachment will automatically connect the Interconnect to the network & region within which the Cloud Router is configured.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] self_link: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] state: [Output Only] The current state of this attachment's functionality. Enum values ACTIVE and UNPROVISIONED are shared by DEDICATED/PRIVATE, PARTNER, and PARTNER_PROVIDER interconnect attachments, while enum values PENDING_PARTNER, PARTNER_REQUEST_RECEIVED, and PENDING_CUSTOMER are used for only PARTNER and PARTNER_PROVIDER interconnect attachments. This state can take one of the following values: 
               - ACTIVE: The attachment has been turned up and is ready to use. 
               - UNPROVISIONED: The attachment is not ready to use yet, because turnup is not complete. 
               - PENDING_PARTNER: A newly-created PARTNER attachment that has not yet been configured on the Partner side. 
               - PARTNER_REQUEST_RECEIVED: A PARTNER attachment is in the process of provisioning after a PARTNER_PROVIDER attachment was created that references it. 
               - PENDING_CUSTOMER: A PARTNER or PARTNER_PROVIDER attachment that is waiting for a customer to activate it. 
               - DEFUNCT: The attachment was deleted externally and is no longer functional. This could be because the associated Interconnect was removed, or because the other side of a Partner attachment was deleted.
