Description: 
        Python to Rust transpiler
        
        This project started as Python to Rust syntax converter. It is not
        aimed at producing ready-to-compile code, but some basic stuff can be
        compiled easily.
        
        It generates unidiomatic non-optimized code with unnecessary
        allocations, but can reduce amount of edits you have to do when
        porting Python projects.
        
        Only basic subset of Python is supported right now and the end goal is
        to support common cases at least as a placeholders.
        
        The project is in experimental, so it may crash or silently skip some
        statements, so be careful.
