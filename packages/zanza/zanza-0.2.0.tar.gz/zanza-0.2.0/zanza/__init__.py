"""
This script obfuscates the input string by the following algorithm:

- Takes the first character of the input string, and gets its Unicode code
  point (character code)
- Sets this char code as a reference value
- Initializes a *list* in which stores the digits of the previous value as a
  *list*
- Continues to the next character by calculating its code point and the delta
  to the previous character's code point.
- Sets the current code point as the next reference value
- Adds this delta value to the return list and repeats the steps above to the
  input strings length.
