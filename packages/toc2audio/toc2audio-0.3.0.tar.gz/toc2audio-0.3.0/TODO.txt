- 20210414: PYPI doesn't recognize ":kbd:" in ReST. I will use ":code:"
  for now.

- 20210413: Examples.

- 20210413: How to install via PYPI.

- 20210413: When specifying time offsets, we should be able to optionally
  specify a title. If present, it should be "inserted" in the TOC.

- 20210413: We could probably trivially support other OGG container based
  audio files.

- 20210413: TOC title for MP3 files should be read from previous metadata
  present in the audio file, not from the Markdown. Other file formats have
  no TOC title.

- 20210413: M4A tagging requires FFMPEG. Can we drop that dependency?

- 20210412: Manage correctly the presence of Markdown tags, links, "#", ";",
  "=", newline, etc in the chapter names.

- 20210411: Document that existing metadata not related to chapters or TOC,
  is not altered.

- 20210410: MP3 VBR: Parse the frames and provide byteoffset for the chapters.
  Would Players suppport it?

- 20210409: Being able to write timestamps in the markdown to tag sections
  without being added as chapters. For instance, using () instead of [].

- 20210409: Tests should create temporal files in memory, not in the harddisk.

- 20210409: Apparently "flit" doesn't allow me to add links in the PYPI
  "Project links" of my project, like "repository" or "changelog".

- 20210409: Publishing ReST to PYPI I lose "warnings" and "notes".

- 20210408: We don't know how long audio is, so we don't know how long is the
  last chapter. For now we asume "24 hours" and hope no audio player crashes.
