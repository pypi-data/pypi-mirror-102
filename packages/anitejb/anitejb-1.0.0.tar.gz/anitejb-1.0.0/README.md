## Overview
A collection of custom [Python](https://www.python.org/) tools and functions developed for me, by me, with <3.

Full disclosure: the functionality provided in this package may exist in various other forms across the depths of the internet. Everything here stems from a personal experience when I needed Python features that were not in-built/importable. I thought would be nice to have all of these things in one place, so here it is.

## Usage
The package is live on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/anitejb). I plan to use it, and you could too! All you need are three magic words: `pip install anitejb`

That being said, keep in mind that this package was developed solely for my own use, and quite literally everything could change at any moment with zero prior notice.

Unless (and even if) you are me, I would not recommend using this on large scale and/or somewhat important projects. You wouldn't want [this](https://xkcd.com/2347/) to happen.
