"""aidkit supports models with the following characteristics:

- Frameworks: Keras, scikit-learn
- Types: recurrent, feedforward
- Tasks: regression, classification

You only need to configure and upload your model once and then you'll be able
to reuse it for future quality analyses (:ref:`example-store-upload-model`).
