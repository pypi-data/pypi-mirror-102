Documentation is in the Tao manual in:
    Section II: Programmer's Guide -> Chapter: Python/GUI Interface.

Note!: If
	1) You are using pytao and 
  2) If pytao is using ctypes (which is the default) and
	3) You are using a Distribution.
Then: You need to have generated a shared object version of the Tao library.
To do this, first edit bmad_dist/util/dist_prefs and set:
	ACC_ENABLE_SHARED="Y"
Next, issue the following commands in the bmad_dist directory:
	./util/dist_clean
	./util/dist_build_production
