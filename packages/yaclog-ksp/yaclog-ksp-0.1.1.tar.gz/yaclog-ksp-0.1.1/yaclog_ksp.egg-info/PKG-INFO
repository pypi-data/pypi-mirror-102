Description: # yaclog-ksp
        
        A command line tool for converting markdown changelogs to [KerbalChangelog] config files.
        
        ## Installation
        
        run `pip install yaclog-ksp`
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        Usage: yaclog-ksp [OPTIONS]
        
          Converts markdown changelogs to KSP changelog configs.
        
        Options:
          -i, --input FILE   Input markdown file to read from.  [default:
                             CHANGELOG.md]
        
          -o, --output FILE  Output file to write to. Uses
                             'GameData/{name}/Versioning/{name}ChangeLog.cfg' by
                             default.
        
          -n, --name TEXT    The name of the mod. Derived from the current directory
                             by default.
        
          --version          Show the version and exit.
          --help             Show this message and exit.
        
        ```
        
        for example, running `yaclog-ksp -i MyLog.md -n "My KSP Mod"`
        would output to `GameData/MyKSPMod/Versioning/MyKSPModChangeLog.cfg`
        
        Input files are in markdown, and use a certain syntax to be readable by the tool. Metadata is included in a table at the
        top of the file (which row you make the header doesnt matter). Each version is an subheading with the version, an
        optional date, and the KSP version as a tag on the end in brackets
