        aiscot receives AIS Sentences from an AIS Receiver, such as ais-decoder,
        converts them to Cursor-on-Target Events, and transmits the CoT Events to a destination.
        
        For use with CoT systems such as ATAK, WinTAK, etc. See https://www.civtak.org/ for more information on the TAK
        program.
        
        Utilized for an open ocean boat race in the Northern Pacific Ocean, as
        described in this article: http://ampledata.org/boat_race_support.html

        ==========================
        
        AISCoT Software development is powered by coffee! Since we probably won't be able to meet in person any time soon, you
        can buy me a virtual coffee here:

        Installation
        ============
        
        The command-line daemon `aiscot` can be install from this source tree (A), or from
        the Python Package Index (PyPI) (B).
        
        A) To install from this source tree::
        
            $ git checkout https://github.com/ampledata/aiscot.git
            $ cd aiscot/
            $ python setup.py install
        
        B) To install from PyPI::
        
            $ pip install aiscot
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        The `aiscot` daemon has several runtime arguments::
        
            $ aiscot --help
            usage: aiscot [-h] [-P AIS_PORT] -C COT_HOST
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -P AIS_PORT, --ais_port AIS_PORT
                                    AIS UDP Port
              -C COT_HOST, --cot_host COT_HOST
                                    Cursor-on-Target Host or Host:Port
        
        For minimum operation, `-P AIS_PORT` & `-C COT_HOST` are required.
        
        The following example listens for AIS Sentences on UDP 0.0.0.0:5050, and
        forwards CoT messages to UDP 172.17.2.222:4242::
        
          $ aiscot -P 5050 -C 172.17.2.222:4242
