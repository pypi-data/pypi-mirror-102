    description: >
      The ensemble data product, SeaFlux (Fay et al. (2021),
      doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4133802, https://github.com/luke-gregor/SeaFlux),
      accounts for the diversity of the underlying mapping methodologies.
      Utilizing six global observation-based mapping products, the SeaFlux ensemble
      approach adjusts for methodological inconsistencies in flux calculations
      that can result in an average error of 15 % in global mean flux estimates.
      We address differences in spatial coverage of the surface ocean CO2
      between the mapping products which ultimately yields an increase in CO2
      uptake of up to 19 % for some products. Fluxes are calculated using three
      wind products (CCMPv2, ERA5, and JRA55).
