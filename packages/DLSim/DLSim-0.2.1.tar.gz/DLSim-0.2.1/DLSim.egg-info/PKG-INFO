Description: # DLSim
        
        DLSim is an open-source, cross-platform, lightweight, and fast Python traffic assignment tool 
        adopted and modified from [ASU Trans+AI Lab](https://github.com/asu-trans-ai-lab/DTALite)
        
        ## Installation
        
        DLSim has been published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dlsim/), and can be installed by using package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install DLSim.
        
        ```bash
        pip install dlsim
        ```
        If you need a specific version of DLSim, say, 0.2.1,
        ```
        $ pip install dlsim==0.2.1
        ```
        
        If you want to test the latest features of DLSim, you can build the package from sources and install it offline, where **Python 3.x** is required.
        ```
        # from the root directory of DLSim
        $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        $ cd dist
        $ python -m pip install dlsim-version.tar.gz
        ``` 
        ## Usage
        
        Find the shortest path (based on distance) and output it in the format of a sequence of node/link IDs.
        
        ```python
        import DLSim as ds
        import time
        
        network = ds.Network()
        
        ds.g_ReadInputData(network.node_list, 
                           network.link_list, 
                           network.agent_list,
                           network.internal_node_seq_no_dict,
                           network.external_node_id_dict,
                           network.agent_td_list_dict,
                           network.zone_to_nodes_dict,network.node_seq_to_link_seq)
        network.allocate()
        
        ds.begin_time = time.time()
        
        ds.g_find_shortest_path_for_agent(network)
        ds.g_TrafficSimulation(network.node_list, network.link_list, 
                               network.agent_list, network.agent_td_list_dict)
        ds.end_time = time.time()
        ds.g_OutputFiles(network.link_list, 
                         network.agent_list, 
                         network.external_node_id_dict)
        ```
