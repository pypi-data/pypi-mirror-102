        # Programming Unity License 10.42
        
        SPDX: Programming-Unity-10.42
        
        ## Purpose
        
        This license gives everyone as much permission to work with this software as possible, while protecting contributors from liability.
        
        ## Acceptance
        
        In order to receive this license, you must agree to its rules.  The rules of this license are both obligations under that agreement and conditions to your license. You must not do anything with this software that triggers a rule that you cannot or will not follow.
        
        ## Copyright
        
        Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe that contributor's copyright in it.
        
        ## Rules
        
        You may only exercise your license in countries with green ticks in the following columns on the [LGBT Rights By Country or Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory) page on Wikipedia.  
        
        - Same-sex marriage
        - Same-sex sexual activity
        - Adoption by same-sex couples
        - Recognition of same-sex unions
        - LGB people allowed to serve openly in military
        - Anti-discrimination laws concerning sexual orientation
         
        Ticks must be visible for 30 continuous days to be considered valid.
        
        ## Ethics
        
        You may only exercise your license if you and your organisation follow, or are striving to follow [The Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice](https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/software-engineering-code) and any future updates.  The document must be re-read every year on or around your birthday where the year is divisible by three or five.
        
        ## Interoperation
        
        Where the licensed software interoperates with "Artificial Intelligence" it may only be used when the use is compliant, or is striving to become compliant with these [AI Ethics](https://www.industry.gov.au/data-and-publications/building-australias-artificial-intelligence-capability/ai-ethics-framework/ai-ethics-principles) or similar comprehensive frameworks designed to protect [Human Rights](https://tech.humanrights.gov.au/human-rights).
        
        ## Notices
        
        You must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any part of this software from you, with or without changes, also gets the text of this license.
        
        ## Excuse
        
        If anyone notifies you in writing that you have not complied with notices, you can keep your license by taking all practical steps to comply within 180 days after the notice.  If you do not do so, your license ends immediately.
        
        ## Patent
        
        Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe any patent claims they can license or become able to license.
        
        ## Reliability
        
        No contributor can revoke this license.
        
        ## No Liability
        
        ***As far as the law allows, this software comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and no contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages related to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim.***
