This project is for Northwestern MSiA 423 Analytics Value Chain Assignment 1. 

The requirments for this assignment are as below:
 
- Create a Python package from the functions in develop-aquastat-functions.ipynb  download. Be sure to add all of the files required for a pip installable Python package and structure the package according to the guidelines from the Python package module.
- Adhere to module writing guidelines from the Writing Python modules lecture.
- Add unit tests in the appropriate location within the package for each testable function. The unit tests for time_slice() have already been developed for you in develop-time-slice-tests.ipynb  download. Bonus points if your unhappy path tests for the other functions cover different use cases than the examples.
- Configure a Python logger through Pythonâ€™s logging package and add logging that includes at least two of the four levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
- Add one-line docstrings to variable_slice() and country_slice()
- Add full docstrings to time_series(), plot_heatmap(), and plot_histogram()
