Description: # subsurface
        
        DataHub for geoscientific data in Python. Two main purposes:
        
        + Unify geometric data into data objects (using numpy arrays as memory representation) that all the packages of the stack understand
        
        + Basic interactions with those data objects:
            + Write/Read
            + Categorized/Meta data
            + Visualization
        
        ## Data Levels:
        The difference between data levels is **not** which data they store but which data they **parse and understand**. The rationale for this is to be able to pass along any object while keeping the I/O in subsurface.

        ## Documentation (WIP)
        
        An early version of the documentation can be found here:

        ## Installation
        
        `pip install subsurface`
        
        Be aware that to read different formats you will need to manually install the specific dependency (e.g. welly to read well data).
        
        ## Changes Log
        
        #### Update 13.06.2020
        
        We are changing things. Help us figure it out!
        
        #### Original statement
        
        The goal of this project is to support other subsurface geoscience and
        engineering projects with a set of classes for common subsurface data entities,
        such as seismic and GPR datasets, log curves, and so on. The current plan is to
         use `xarray` under the hood, with `pint` for units support and `cartopy` for CRS and map support.
        
        It's early days, everything might change. Help us figure it out!
