# Karma Farmer
Generates karma for user running this script by participating in r/KarmaStreet, where it uploads a post for a user and upvotes other active users. This was kinda a side project for me however if it gains attraction I'll possibly add new features. Nevertheless it works as is. Now it just needs more participating users...

### Python Installation

```sh
sudo apt install python3
python3 -m pip install KarmaFarmer
```
