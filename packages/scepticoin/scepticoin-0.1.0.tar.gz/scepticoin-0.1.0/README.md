## Scepticoin
The Coin for non-believers

### What is Scepticoin?

Scepticoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency that enables you to send money
online. It's also the central community of people who think that's bullshit.

### What's your problem with Crypto?

### Why a coin then?

Crypto-enthousiasts have an incentive to be loud about crypto-currency: the
more other people they convince, the richer they themselves become. Crypto-sceptics
are a silent majority: they have no such incentive, so you never hear them.
Scepticoin changes that, by making the sceptics invested in a coin themselves.
