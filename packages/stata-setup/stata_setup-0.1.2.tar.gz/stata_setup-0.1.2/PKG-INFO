Description: 
        stata_setup 
        ===========
        
        The **stata_setup** module is used to configure and initialize Stata within 
        Python. After the initialization, you can use the 
        `pystata <https://www.stata.com/python/pystata>`__ Python package, which is 
        shipped with Stata 17, to interact Stata with Python. 
        
        After the module is installed, you can type
        
          >>> import stata_setup
          >>> stata_setup.config('your_stata_installation_directory', 'your_stata_edition')
        
        in your Python environment to initialize Stata. For example, if you have Stata 
        installed in **C:\\Program Files\\Stata17\\** and you use the **Stata/MP** edition,  
        then Stata can be initialized as follows:
        
          >>> import stata_setup
          >>> stata_setup.config('C:/Program Files/Stata17/', 'mp')
        
        See `Configuration <https://www.stata.com/python/pystata/install.html#method-1-installing-via-pip>`__ 
        for more information on how to configure and initialize Stata from within 
        Python. 
        
        **stata_setup** runs with Python 2.7+ and 3.4+.
