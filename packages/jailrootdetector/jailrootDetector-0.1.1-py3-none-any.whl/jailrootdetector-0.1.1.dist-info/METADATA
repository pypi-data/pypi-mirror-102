#+TITLE: jailrootDetector

Attempted automation to detect root and jailbreak detection in mobile applications.

* Example Usage

Detect common detection strings like "jailbroken" and "rooted" as well as a few others. The script leverages [[https://www.radare.org/r/][radare2]] and [[https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/binutils/strings.html][GNU strings]] to attempt to quickly identify if that application is going to give you a hard time.

** Demo

#+begin_src shell :results output :dir ./jailrootdetector/ :exports both
  jrd --help
#+end_src

The script *does not* extract the IPA or APK, It assums you know how to do that ;) .

#+RESULTS:
: usage: jrd [-h] (--dex DEX | --ios IOS)
: 
: [+] root & jailbreak detection
: 
: optional arguments:
:   -h, --help  show this help message and exit
:   --dex DEX   path to android dex file
:   --ios IOS   path to extracted payload binary

Once you have an extracted app, then run the script with the relevant option, for example;

#+begin_src shell :results output :dir ./jailrootdetector/ :exports both
  jrd --ios ./Documents/IPAs/Discord/Payload/Discord.app/Discord
#+end_src

Then the script will atempt to find hard-coded well known detection strings, frist with [[https://www.radare.org/r/][radare2]] and then falls back to [[https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/binutils/strings.html][GNU strings]].

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
[+] "jailbroken" detected in ./Documents/IPAs/Discord/Payload/Discord.app/Discord
0x100d1be97 11 10 jailbroken
0x100d1c0dc 13 12 isJailbroken
0x100d1c0e9 22 21 TB,R,N,V_isJailbroken
0x100ddcc6b 20 19 computeIsJailbroken
0x100ddcd0a 13 12 isJailbroken
0x100ddcd57 14 13 _isJailbroken


[+] "/Applications/Cydia.app" detected in ./Documents/IPAs/Discord/Payload/Discord.app/Discord
/Applications/Cydia.app


[+] "/bin/bash" detected in ./Documents/IPAs/Discord/Payload/Discord.app/Discord
/bin/bash


[+] "/bin/sh" detected in ./Documents/IPAs/Discord/Payload/Discord.app/Discord
/bin/sh

#+end_example

* Installation

You can install with =pip3=.

#+begin_src shell :results output
  pip3 install jailrootdetector
#+end_src

Or you can install with [[https://python-poetry.org/][poetry]]

#+begin_src shell :results output
  git clone https://gitlab.com/JxTx/jailrootdetector && \
    cd jailrootdetector && \
    poetry install && \
    poetry shell
    jrd --help
#+end_src

if all else fails, here is a checklist of dependencies.

 - [[https://www.radare.org/r/][radare2]]
   - Use the [[https://www.radare.org/r/down.html][installation documentation]] for this.
 - [[https://www.radare.org/n/r2pipe.html][r2pipe]]
   - This can be installed with =pip3 install r2pipe=
 - [[https://pypi.org/project/sh/][sh]]
   - This can be installed with =pip3 install sh=
 - [[https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/binutils/strings.html][GNU Strings]]
   - This should already be installed on your system, if not you should be able to install it with your package manager.
