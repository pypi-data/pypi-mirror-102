Description: # imagedataextractor
        
        **imagedataextractor** is a Python library for electron microscopy image quantification.
        
        Try the online [Demo](https://imagedataextractor.org/demo).
        
        ## Features
        
        - Automatic detection and download of microscopy images from scientific articles.
        - Particle segmentation with uncertainty quantification.
        - Particle localization.
        - Automatic scalebar detection (reading and measurement).
        - Particle size distributions.
        - Locations, sizes and aspect ratios of all particles in an image (in the form of a .csv file).
        - Radial distribution functions of extracted particle systems.
        
        ## Installation
        
        We strongly recommend the use of a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) for installation, as **imagedataextractor** requires specific versions of its requirements to be installed in order to function as intended.
        
        #### Install Tesseract
        
        **imagedataextractor** requires [Tesseract 4](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html). Installation instructions for Tesseract can be found [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html). On Linux, this is very simple:
        
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr libtesseract-dev
        ```
        
        #### Installation with `pip` (recommended)
        
        ```bash
        pip install imagedataextractor
        ```
        
        #### Installation from source
        
        1. Clone the repo:
        
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/by256/imagedataextractor.git
        ```
        
        2. Install requirements:
        
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Simply provide as input a path to an image or a document, or a path to a directory of images and/or documents, as well as an output directory which specifies where you would like the results to be written to.
        
        ```python
        import imagedataextractor as ide
        
        input_path = '<path/to/inputs>'
        output_dir = '<dir/to/write/results/to>'
        ide.extract(input_path, output_dir)
        ```
        
        If the input image is a figure containing a panel of images, these will be split and extraction will be performed on each sub-image separately.
        
        A more detailed usage guide can be found in the [Documentation](https://imagedataextractor.org/docs/usage).
