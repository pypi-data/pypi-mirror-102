# SignalR core client (async fork)
![Pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/aiosignalrcore.svg)

This is asyncio version of the original SignalR Core [library](https://github.com/mandrewcito/signalrcore).  
The main difference is that `websocket` library is replaced with asyncio-compatabile `websockets`.  
All future changes in the original repo will be merged to this fork inheriting the major and minor version number.
