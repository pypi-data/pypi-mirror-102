Description: # `bandlab-master`
        
        `bandlab-master` is a Python script that uploads a song to your [BandLab](https://www.bandlab.com/) account, masters it with default settings, and downloads it as WAV. Eventually, I will update this to delete the temporary project once its master downloads.
        
        `balndlab-master` uses my amazingly clever (and probably terrible) [`webdriver-extended`](https://github.com/zmarffy/webdriver-extended).
        
        ## Requirements
        
        * Chromium/Google Chrome
        * `chromedriver`
        
        ## Usage
        
        `bandlab-master [file_to_master]`
        
        (Wow, that was confusing.)
        
        Make sure your BandLab credentials are in `~/.bandlab/.creds`, username on first line and password on second.
