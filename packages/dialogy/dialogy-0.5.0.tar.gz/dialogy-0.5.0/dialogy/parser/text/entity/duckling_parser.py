.. _duckling_parser:

This module exposes a parser for `Duckling <https://github.com/facebook/duckling>`_.

`Duckling <https://github.com/facebook/duckling>`_ helps parsing values like: :code:`date`, :code:`time`,
:code:`numbers`, :code:`currency` etc. The parser will expect Duckling to be running as an http service, and provide
means to connect from the implementation here.

    A :ref:`Plugin<plugin>` for extracting entities using `Duckling <https://github.com/facebook/duckling>`_. Once
    instantiated, a :code:`duckling_parser` object will interface to an http server, running `Duckling
    <https://github.com/facebook/duckling>`_.

    This object when used as a plugin, transforms the :code:`List[Dict[str, Any]]` returned from the API to a
    :ref:`BaseEntity<base_entity>` or one of its subclasses.

    :param dimensions: `Dimensions <https://github.com/facebook/duckling#supported-dimensions>`_. Of the listed
    dimensions, we support:

        - `Numeral`
        - `Time`
        - `TimeInterval`
        - `Duration`
        - `People` - This isn't part of the standard, we have a private fork to support this.

        Do note, passing more dimensions is not free. Duckling would search for extra set of patterns just because
        those dimensions were expected.

        `ISO3166 alpha2 country code <https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/>`_ for country codes.
