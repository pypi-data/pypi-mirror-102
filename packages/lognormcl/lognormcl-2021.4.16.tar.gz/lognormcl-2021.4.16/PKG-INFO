        =========
        
        **angular power spectra of lognormal random fields**
        
        This is a minimal Python package for working with the angular power spectra of
        lognormal spherical random fields.  It can currently convert between the power
        spectra of lognormal random fields and their constituent normal random fields.
        
        The package can be installed using pip:
        
            pip install lognormcl
        
        Then import the `ln2n` and `n2ln` functions from the package:
        
            from lognormcl import ln2n, n2ln
        
        For more information, please see the [documentation].
        
        Current functionality covers the absolutely minimal use case.  Please open an
        issue on GitHub if you would like to see anything added.
