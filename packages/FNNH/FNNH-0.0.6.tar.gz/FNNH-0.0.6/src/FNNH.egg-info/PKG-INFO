Description: # FNN-Hash (Flexible Neural Network - Hash)
        
        A flexible **EXPERIMENTAL** Hashing algorithm that uses Neural Network architecture to calculate the Hash of a given string.
        
        ### Some Notes
        * *the node activation function is a threshold gate.*
        * *the number of nodes in inputlayer = 2 x no. of nodes in outout layer* 
        * *and those number of nodes changed by user easily thus changing the size of hash generated.(max size = 1024 NOTE: 1024 size hash takes a lot of time so be patient when you request for a hash size of 1024)*
        
        ### Requirements
        
        * make sure you have `NUMPY` (Thise was made on version `1.19.2`)
        
        ### HOW TO USE
        
        1. Run the Command `pip install FNNH` in your python ENV.
        2. and to use the algo write :
        ```python
        from FNNH import FNNH
        
        data = "qwerty"
        sizeofhash = 16
        rounds = 64
        
        thehash = FNNH(data,sizeofhash,rounds)
        ```
