thumbor is a smart imaging service. It enables on-demand [crop, resizing and flipping](http://thumbor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/crop_and_resize_algorithms.html) of images.

It also features a VERY smart detection of important points in the image for better cropping and resizing, using state-of-the-art face and feature detection algorithms (more on that in [Detection Algorithms](http://thumbor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/detection_algorithms.html)).

Using thumbor is very easy (after it is running). All you have to do is access it using an URL for an image, like this:

```
http://<thumbor-server>/300x200/smart/s.glbimg.com/et/bb/f/original/2011/03/24/VN0JiwzmOw0b0lg.jpg
```

That URL would show an image of the big brother brasil participants in 300x200 using smart crop.

There are several other options to the image URL configuration. You can check them in the [Usage page](http://thumbor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html).

For more information check [thumbor's
documentation](http://thumbor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html "thumbor docs").

# dffrntlab part

## Where it is

https://pypi.org/project/dffrntlab-thumbor/

## Push to PyPi

```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
# install twine if you don't have
# pip install twine
twine upload dist/*
```

Now we use this profile to push packages: https://pypi.org/user/maximka777/ _(need to register dffrntlab one)_.

## How to run locally

At first we need to install all dependencies via `make setup`.

Run via:
```sh
pip install .
# or `pip2 install .` when we have to ask use of Python 2 pip explicitly
make run-with-config
```

_When you changed something in project you need to reinstall application via `pip install .`_

In this configuration `./thumbor/thumbor.conf` file you can specify detector in `DETECTORS` (e.g.: primary color detector -> `'thumbor.detectors.primary_color_detector'`).

Also we can run Thumbor via _(without reinstalling)_: `make`.

### Filter out external requests

To filter out external requests Thumbor check `Host` header if it ends with top level domain. List of TLDs you can specify in `TOP_LEVEL_DOMAINS` configuration field (by default it is `['com']`).
This check is applied only for `POST /image` endpoint.
