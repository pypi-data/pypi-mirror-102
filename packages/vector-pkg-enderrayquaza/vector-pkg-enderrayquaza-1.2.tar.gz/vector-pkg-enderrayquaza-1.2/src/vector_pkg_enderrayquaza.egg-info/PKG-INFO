Description: # Vector pkg
        
        ### How to install
        - Windows
         ```shell
         pip install vector-pkg-EnderRayquaza
         ```
        ### How to use
        ```Python
        import Vector as vec
        v = vec.Vector(5, 7.5) #Creates a instance of Vector
        print(v.x) #Shows his composant x >>> 5
        print(v.y) #Idem                  >>> 7.5
        print(v.st) #Shows his standard   >>> 9.013878188659973
        
        u = vec.Vector(-8, 0.25) #Creates an other instance of Vector
        w = v+u #Makes a instance of Vector with composants (v.x + u.x; v.y + u.y)
        print(w.x, w.y) # >>> -3 7.75
        w = v-u #Idem but with a subtraction
        print(w.x, w.y) # >>> 13 7.25
        
        k = 5
        w = v*k
        print(w.x, w.y) # >>> 25, 37.5
        
        #You can do this too
        v += u
        v -= u
        v *= k
        
        p = v**u #Calculates the scalar product of v and u          
        print(p) # >>> -38.125
        a = v%u  #Calculates the angle (in degrees) between v and u
        print(a) # >>> 121.90015691773374
        z = complex(v) #Makes a complex number equal at x+yi
        print(z) # >>> (5+7.5j)
        ```
