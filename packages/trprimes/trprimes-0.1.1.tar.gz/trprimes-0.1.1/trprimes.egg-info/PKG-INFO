Description: # Truncatable primes
        
        A Python library that generates that generates sequences of truncatable
        prime numbers and derivatives of the sequences in the form of a package
        that can be installed and imported.
        
        A truncatable prime is still prime when number is truncated.  For example,
        317 is a left truncatable prime because 17 and 7 are prime.  It is also a
        right truncatable prime because 31 and 3 are prime.
        
        The intention of this library is to provide code that is reasonably efficient
        and readable.  It is not difficult to track down cryptic one-liner code
        that produces identical results.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        Python 3 is assumed.
        
        ### Installing
        
        Using the source code from github
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/harry-zuzan/trprimes.git
        cd trprimes
        python setup.py install
        
        ```
        
        Using pip
        ```
        pip install trprimes
        
        ```
        
        
        ### Examples
        ```
        from trprimes import trunc
        
        # the number of left truncatable primes
        trunc.count_ltrunc()
        
        # the largest of left truncatable prime
        trunc.largest_ltrunc()
        
        # iterate through left truncatable primes in ascending order
        ltp = trunc.ordered_ltrunc()
        next(ltp)
        
        ```
