Description: 
        a easy to use database,that is better,faster,more intuitive,EASY than any other database out there
        
        
        This handy tool is meant for pure databasing, go to main.py for an example of most of the commands
        
        
        if you want to have 1 entry only,and delete system we would recommend using store_new_content, but if you want to make it so that once the code is done
        to just repeat the system on the next line use add_content
        
        we do not recommend opening DATAX_API_FILES directory(folder) manualy,as this gives higher chance of file corruption,instead use show_content("FILENAME") for the system to open it.
        
        Json is also avalible.].
        
        
        Todo:
        single line show content(intiger error)
