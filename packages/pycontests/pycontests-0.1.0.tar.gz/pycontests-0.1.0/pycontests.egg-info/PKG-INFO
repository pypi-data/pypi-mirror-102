Description: # Solve for Mixed Strategy Equilibrium of All-Pay Contests with Spillovers
        
        This package currently can estimate the mixed strategy equilibrium of an asymmetric all pay contest with spillovers. It uses the matrix inversion method established in [Betto and Thomas (2021)](https://mattwthomas.com/papers/asymmetric-all-pay-contests-with-spillovers/).
        
        The package is not yet complete and the commands are subject to design changes. Better documentation is forthcoming.
