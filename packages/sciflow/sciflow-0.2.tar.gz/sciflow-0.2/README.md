## SciFlow: A SciData workflow system
This project is to develop a web-based processing system, built in Django, to 
manage the ingestion of [SciData](http://stuchalk.github.io/scidata/) 
framework formatted [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) documents into a graph 
database. The system allows one or more files to be validated, normalized,
logged and ingest into the graph database.  The system acts as a 
cataloging tool to see what is in the graph DB.
