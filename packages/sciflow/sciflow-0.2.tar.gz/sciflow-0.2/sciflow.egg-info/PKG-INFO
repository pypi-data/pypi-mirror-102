Description: ## SciFlow: A SciData workflow system
        This project is to develop a web-based processing system, built in Django, to 
        manage the ingestion of [SciData](http://stuchalk.github.io/scidata/) 
        framework formatted [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) documents into a graph 
        database. The system allows one or more files to be validated, normalized,
        logged and ingest into the graph database.  The system acts as a 
        cataloging tool to see what is in the graph DB.
