Description: # gcptree
        
        Like the unix `tree` command but for GCP Org Heirarchy.
        
        ![](screenshot.png)
        
        For a note on coloring, the org node is green, folders and blue, and projects that are not `ACTIVE` are dimmed. These styles won't show up if you redirect output and Windows is supported by virtue of the `colorama` package.
        
        # Installation
        
        ```
        pip install gcptree
        ```
        
        # Usage
        
        ```
        $ gcptree --help
        usage: gcptree [-h] [--format FORMAT] [--full-resource] org_id
        
        Print out a GCP org heirarchy
        
        positional arguments:
          org_id           GCP Organization ID
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help       show this help message and exit
          --format FORMAT  Output format (json or text)
          --full-resource  API-parsable nodes where org and folder resource names are not resolved, i.e org/123 instead of example.com
        ```
        
        ## Permissions
        
        The minimum role you'll need **at the organization level** is:
        
        * `roles/browser`
        
        The actual permissions needed (in case you want a custom role) are:
        
        * `resourcemanager.projects.get`
        * `resourcemanager.projects.list`
        * `resourcemanager.folders.get`
        * `resourcemanager.organizations.get`
