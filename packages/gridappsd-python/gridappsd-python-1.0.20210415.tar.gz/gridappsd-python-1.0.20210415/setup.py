    'long_description': '![Build status](https://github.com/GRIDAPPSD/gridappsd-python/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg)\n\n# gridappsd-python\nPython library for developing applications and services against the gridappsd api\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe gridappsd-python library requires a  python version >= 3.6 and < 4 in order to work properly (Note no testing\nhas been done with python 4 to date).\n\n## Installation\n\nThe recommended installation of `gridappsd-python` is in a separate virtual environment.  Executing the following\nwill create an environment called `griddapps-env`.\n\n```shell\npython3 -m venv gridappsd-env\n```\n\nSourcing the gridappsd-env activates the newly created python environment.\n\n```shell\nsource gridappsd-env/bin/activate\n```\n\nUpgrade pip to the latest (some packages require 19.0+ version of pip).\n\n```shell\npython -m pip install pip --upgrade\n```\n\nInstall the latest `gridappsd-python` and its dependencies in the virtual environment.\n\n```shell\npip install gridappsd-python\n```\n\n### Verifying things are working properly\n\nThe following code snippet assumes you have created a gridappsd instance using the steps in\nhttps://github.com/GRIDAPPSD/gridappsd-docker.\n\nCreate a test script (tester.py) with the following content.\n\n```python\n\nfrom gridappsd import GridAPPSD\n\ndef on_message_callback(header, message):\n    print(f"header: {header} message: {message}")\n\n# Note these should be changed on the server in a cyber secure environment!\nusername = "app_user"\npassword = "1234App"\n\n# Note: there are other parameters for connecting to\n# systems other than localhost\ngapps = GridAPPSD(username=username, password=password)\n\nassert gapps.connected\n\ngapps.send(\'send.topic\', {"foo": "bar"})\n\n# Note we are sending the function not executing the function in the second parameter\ngapps.subscribe(\'subscribe.topic\', on_message_callback)\n\ngapps.send(\'subcribe.topic\', \'A message about subscription\')\n\ntime.sleep(5)\n\ngapps.close()\n\n```\n\nStart up the gridappsd-docker enabled platform.  Then run the following to execute the tester.py script\n\n```shell\npython tester.py\n```\n\n## Application Developers\n\nDeveloping applications against gridappsd using the `gridappsd-python` library should follow the same steps\nas above, however with a couple of environmental variables specified.  The following environmental variables are\navailable to provide the same context that would be available from inside the application docker container.  These\nare useful to know for developing your application outside of the docker context (e.g. in a python notebook).\n\n***NOTE: you can also define these your ~./bashrc file so you don\'t have to specify them all the time***\n\n```shell\n# export allows all processes started by this shell to have access to the global variable\n\n# address where the gridappsd server is running - default localhost\nexport GRIDAPPSD_ADDRESS=localhost\n\n# port to connect to on the gridappsd server (the stomp client port)\nexport GRIDAPPSD_PORT=61613\n\n# username to connect to the gridappsd server\nexport GRIDAPPSD_USER=app_user\n\n# password to connect to the gridappsd server\nexport GRIDAPPSD_PASSWORD=1234App\n\n# Note these should be changed on the server in a cyber secure environment!\n```\n\nThe following is the same tester code as above, but with the environment variables set.  The environment variables\nshould be set in your environment when running the application inside our docker container.\n\n```python\n\nfrom gridappsd import GridAPPSD\n\ndef on_message_callback(header, message):\n    print(f"header: {header} message: {message}")\n\n# Create GridAPPSD object and connect to the gridappsd server.\ngapps = GridAPPSD()\n\nassert gapps.connected\n\ngapps.send(\'send.topic\', {"foo": "bar"})\n\n# Note we are sending the function not executing the function in the second parameter\ngapps.subscribe(\'subscribe.topic\', on_message_callback)\n\ngapps.send(\'subcribe.topic\', \'A message about subscription\')\n\ntime.sleep(5)\n\ngapps.close()\n\n```\n\n## Developers\n\nThis project uses poetry to build the environment for execution.  Follow the instructions\nhttps://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation to install poetry.  As a developer I prefer not to have poetry installed\nin the same virtual environment that my projects are in.\n\nClone the github repository:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/GRIDAPPSD/gridappsd-python -b develop\ncd gridappsd-python\n```\n\nThe following commands build and install a local wheel into an environment created just for this package.\n\n```shell\n# Build the project (stores in dist directory both .tar.gz and .whl file)\npoetry build\n\n# Install the wheel into the environment and the dev dependencies\npoetry install\n\n# Install only the library dependencies\npoetry install --no-dev\n```\n\n***Note:*** Poetry does not have a setup.py that you can install in editable mode like with pip install -e ., however\nyou can extract the generated setup.py file from the built tar.gz file in the dist directory.  Just extract the\n.tar.gz file and copy the setup.py file from the extracted directory to the root of gridappsd-python.  Then you can\nenable editing through pip install -e. as normal.\n\n\n## Testing\n\nTesting has become an integral part of the software lifecycle.  The `gridappsd-python` library has both unit and\nintegration tests available to be run.  In order to execute these, you must have installed the gridappsd-python library\nas above with dev-dependencies.\n\nDuring the testing phase the docker containers required for the tests are downloaded from\ndockerhub and started.  By default the `develop` tag is used to test the library using pytest.  \nOne can customize the docker image tag by setting the environmental\nvariable `GRIDAPPSD_TAG_ENV` either by `export GRIDAPPSD_TAG_ENV=other_tag` or by executing \npytest with the following:\n\n```shell script\n\n# Export environmental variables and all tests will use the same tag (other_tag) to pull from docker hub.\n# Default tag is develop\nexport GRIDAPPSD_TAG_ENV=other_tag\npytest\n\n# Tests also require the username and password to be avaialable as environmental variables \n# in order for them to properly run these tests\nexport GRIDAPPSD_USER=user\nexport GRIDAPPSD_PASSWORD=pass\n\npytest\n```\n\n ***NOTE: the first running the tests will download all of the docker images associated with the\n [GOSS-GridAPPS-D](http://github.com/GRIDAPPSD/GOSS-GridAPPS-D) repository.  This process may take some time.***\n \n### Running tests created in a new project\n\nThe `gridappsd-python` library exposes a testing environment through the `gridappsd.docker_handler` module.  Including the following\n`conftest.py` in the root of your base test directory allows tests to reference these.  Using these fixtures will start all of the\nbase containers required for `gridappsd` to run.  \n\n```python\n\n# conftest.py\n# Create a conftest.py file in the root of the tests directory to enable usage throughout the tests directory and below. \n# \n# Tested project structure an layout\n#\n# project-folder\\\n#   mainmodule\\\n#     __init__.py\n#     myapplication.py\n#   tests\\\n#     conftest.py\n#     test_myapplication.py\n#   README.md\n\nimport os\n\nimport pytest\n\nfrom gridappsd import GridAPPSD\nfrom gridappsd.docker_handler import run_dependency_containers, run_gridappsd_container, Containers\n\n# If set to False then None of the containers will clean up after themselves.\n# If more than one test is ran then this will cause an error because the gridappsd\n# container will not be cleansed.\nSTOP_CONTAINER_AFTER_TEST = os.environ.get("GRIDAPPSD_STOP_CONTAINERS_AFTER_TESTS", True)\n\nif isinstance(STOP_CONTAINER_AFTER_TEST, str):\n    if STOP_CONTAINER_AFTER_TEST.lower() == \'false\' or STOP_CONTAINER_AFTER_TEST.lower() != \'0\':\n        STOP_CONTAINER_AFTER_TEST = False\n    else:\n        STOP_CONTAINER_AFTER_TEST = True\n\n\n@pytest.fixture(scope="module")\ndef docker_dependencies():\n    print("Docker dependencies")\n    Containers.reset_all_containers()\n\n    with run_dependency_containers(stop_after=STOP_CONTAINER_AFTER_TEST) as dep:\n        yield dep\n    print("Cleanup docker dependencies")\n\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef gridappsd_client(docker_dependencies):\n    with run_gridappsd_container(stop_after=STOP_CONTAINER_AFTER_TEST):\n        gappsd = GridAPPSD()\n        gappsd.connect()\n        assert gappsd.connected\n\n        yield gappsd\n\n        gappsd.disconnect()\n\n```\n\nUsing the above fixtures from inside a test module and test function looks like the following:\n\n```python\n\n# Example test function using the gridappsd_client fixture \n\n@mock.patch.dict(os.environ, {"GRIDAPPSD_APPLICATION_ID": "helics_goss_bridge.py"})\ndef test_gridappsd_status(gridappsd_client):\n    gappsd = gridappsd_client\n    assert "helics_goss_bridge.py" == gappsd.get_application_id()\n    assert gappsd.get_application_status() == ProcessStatusEnum.STARTING.value\n    assert gappsd.get_service_status() == ProcessStatusEnum.STARTING.value\n    gappsd.set_application_status("RUNNING")\n\n    assert gappsd.get_service_status() == ProcessStatusEnum.RUNNING.value\n    assert gappsd.get_application_status() == ProcessStatusEnum.RUNNING.value\n\n    gappsd.set_service_status("COMPLETE")\n    assert gappsd.get_service_status() == ProcessStatusEnum.COMPLETE.value\n    assert gappsd.get_application_status() == ProcessStatusEnum.COMPLETE.value\n\n    # Invalid\n    gappsd.set_service_status("Foo")\n    assert gappsd.get_service_status() == ProcessStatusEnum.COMPLETE.value\n    assert gappsd.get_application_status() == ProcessStatusEnum.COMPLETE.value\n\n```\n\n',
