# K_DeZero

## Overview

This library is an my improved version of "Deep Learning from Basic 3".
(In production)

## Requirement

- Python3.8
- If you use gpu, cupy
- If you want to visualize the model, install graphviz
- For details, see requirements.txt

## Usage

Method1:
```
pip install kdezero
```

Method2:
```
git clone https://github.com/kotabrog/K_DeZero.git
