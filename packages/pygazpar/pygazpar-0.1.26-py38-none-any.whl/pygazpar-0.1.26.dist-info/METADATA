# PyGazpar
PyGazpar is a Python library for getting natural gas consumption from GrDF French provider.

Their natural gas meter is called Gazpar. It is wireless and transmit the gas consumption once per day.

All consumption data is available on the client account at GrDF Web Site (https://monespace.grdf.fr).

PyGazpar automatically go through the Web Site and download the consumption data Excel file, and make it available in a Python structure (list of dictionaries).

## Installation

### Requirements
PyGazpar is working with Selenium Python library to automate navigation through GrDF Web site. Selenium requires a WebDriver that acts as gateway between automatic actions from PyGazpar and a native browser already installed on the system.

PyGazpar has been developped and tested with Firefox browser (version 68.8) and its corresponding Web Driver geckodriver (version 0.24).

#### Firefox browser installation
Follow instructions [here](https://www.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/new)

#### Firefox Web Driver (geckodriver) installation
Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

### Create your virtual environment
```bash
$ pip install virtualenv

$ cd /path/to/my_project_folder/

$ virtualenv venv
```

### PyGazpar installation
Activate your virtual environment.
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install PyGazpar.

```bash
pip install pygazpar
```

You can also download the source code and install it manually.

```bash
cd /path/to/pygazpar/
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

### Command line

```bash
$ pygazpar -u 'your login' -p 'your password' -w 'path/to/Selenium Web Driver' -s 30 -t 'temporary directory where to store XSLX file (ex: /tmp)'
```

### Library

```python
import pygazpar

client = pygazpar.Client('your login',
                         'your password',
                         'path/to/Selenium Web Driver',
                         30,
                         'temporary directory where to store XSLX file (ex: /tmp)')

client.update()

data = client.data()
```

### Output

```json
data =>
[
  {
    "date": "01/07/2019",
    "start_index_m3": 9802.0,
    "end_index_m3": 9805.0,

    "timestamp": "2019-08-29T16:56:07.380422"
  }
]
```

## Limitation
PyGazpar relies on how GrDF Web Site is built. It goes through each Web pages and automatically fill forms, click buttons using their internal identifiers.

Any change in the Web site structure or identifier naming may break this library.

We expect in close Future that GrDF makes available a standard API from which we can get safely their data.

## [0.1.26](https://github.com/ssenart/PyGazpar/compare/0.1.25...0.1.26) - 2021-04-18
### Fixed
- [#10](https://github.com/ssenart/PyGazpar/issues/10) : Does not download data file in tmpdir as expected (instead it is downloaded in the default user Download directory).

### Added
- A new parameter to drive whether we want Selenium in headless mode or not (mainly for troubleshooting purpose).

## [0.1.25] - 2021-04-15
### Fixed
- Remove useless warning log messages (log message level has been decreased to debug).

### Added

### Fixed
- Typo in logger usage.

## [0.1.17] - 2021-04-05
### Fixed
- Logger name must be different in each instance. Using __name__ is a good practice, we can get the module hierarchy.

## [0.1.16] - 2021-04-05
### Fixed
- Logger 'pygazpar' initialization must be done inside the main program and not inside the library.

## [0.1.15] - 2021-04-05
### Added
- Many log message to help debugging if GrDF site changes something : pygazpar.log
- Take a screenshot of the corresponding page where a selenium command fails : error_screenshot.png.

### Fixed
- GrDF survey popup has to be closed at the home page.

## [0.1.13] - 2020-06-30
### Fixed
- GrDF data retrieval from Excel file is not limited to the 1000 first rows any more.

## [0.1.12] - 2020-06-30
### Fixed
- The previous 0.1.11 is not sufficient. Hence, 2 new changes : First, make configurable the waiting time so the user can adapt to its context usage.
Second, the condition on clicking on Download button is now based on the corresponding event and not anymore on its identifier. 

## [0.1.11] - 2020-06-29
### Fixed
- When GrDF Web site is slower than usual, the client may not wait enough time for pages to load and miss to reach the data file.
It occurs with the page containing 'Jour' button which is very long to load (I increase the wait to load time from 5s to 30s).

## [0.1.10] - 2020-06-03
### Fixed
- Extract rows from Excel until line 1000 (instead of 365 as before).

## [0.1.9] - 2019-08-31
### Fixed
- WebDriver window size must be large enough to display all clickable components.

## [0.1.8] - 2019-08-31

- Add LoginError exception raised when PyGazpar is unable to sign in the GrDF Web site with the given username/password.
- Refactor all data property names.

## [0.1.6] - 2019-08-26
### Added
- Add README.md and CHANGELOG.md.
- Add Client.data() method to get the updated data.

### Removed
- Remove Client.data property to get the updated data. Replaced with Client.__data private property.
