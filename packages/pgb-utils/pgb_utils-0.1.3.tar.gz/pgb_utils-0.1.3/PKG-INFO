Description: # `pgb_utils`: Tools for interacting with Pitt-Google Broker
        
        See [Pitt-Google-Tutorial-Code-Samples.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/broker-workshop/tutorials/blob/main/Pitt-Google/Pitt-Google-Tutorial-Code-Samples.ipynb) for an intro on using this package to access the data.
        
        `pgb_utils` is a collection of helper functions to facilitate interaction with Pitt-Google Broker data. The tutorial will demonstrate its use. The package is essentially a set of:
        
        1. Convience wrappers for the [Google Cloud Python SDK](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference)
        2. Helper functions for ZTF data decoding and plotting, provided by ZTF (see [Filtering_alerts.ipynb](https://github.com/ZwickyTransientFacility/ztf-avro-alert/blob/master/notebooks/Filtering_alerts.ipynb))
        3. Helper functions for running [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) pipelines
        
        You are encouraged to look at and alter the source code to learn how to use the underlying methods yourself.
        
        Modules and their functionality include:
        
        - `pgb_utils.beam`
            - helper functions for running Apache Beam data pipelines
        
        - `pgb_utils.bigquery`
            - view dataset, table, and schema information
            - query: lightcurves
            - query: cone search
            - cast query results to a `pandas.DataFrame` or `json` formatted string.
        
        - `pgb_utils.figures`
            - plot lightcurves
            - plot cutouts
        
        - `pgb_utils.utils`
            - general utilities such as data type casting
