## SAT-X [![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/satx)](https://pepy.tech/project/satx)

The SAT-X system is a CNF compiler and SAT solver built into Python.

## Installation
```python
pip install satx
```

Note: SAT-X is an experimental and under research extension of www.PEQNP.com work different, with support for negative numbers, modular arithmetics, and more...

#### Current Status:
- In version 0.0.5, most of the PEQNP examples work by adding a bit or putting the appropriate restrictions, considering that in PEQNP the variables are bounded from 0.

- Absolute values, and some things related to expressions like one_of ([x - y, y - x]) don't work correctly.
