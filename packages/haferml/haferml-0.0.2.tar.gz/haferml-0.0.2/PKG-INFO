Description: # Hafer ML
        
        The HomemAde FramEwoRk for Machine Learning (HAFER ML) is a minimal and unambitious framework for your machine learning projects, with reproducibility in mind.

        ## The Idea
        
        The Hafer ML frameworks is very simple. It is a minimal framework that I have been applying to small projects. Hafer ML save the artifacts at every step to make it easy to reproduce. The tool we choose to make it reproducible is Docker.
