## With support for Production, EscapePod and OSKR robots!

This is a fork of the original Anki Vector Python SDK.
I have started this fork as an unofficial version to keep things moving.

## Getting Started

You can follow steps [here](https://developer.anki.com/vector/docs/index.html) to set up your Vector robot with the SDK.

### Installation

In case you have previously installed the original anki or ikkez sdk, uninstall it with following commands:
```
pip uninstall anki_vector
pip uninstall ikkez_vector
```

To install this SDK, run:
```
pip install cyb3r_vector_sdk
```

You can upgrade to latest version with:
```
pip install cyb3r_vector_sdk --upgrade
```

### SDK Configuration

To configure the SDK for **Prod**, and/or **Prod+OSKR** robot, run:

```
py -m anki_vector.configure
```

To condigure the SDK for **EscapePod**, and/or **EP+OSKR** robot, run:

```
py -m anki_vector.configure_pod
```

### SDK Usage - EscapePod 

You can either use the ```anki_vector.configure_pod``` in order to save your authentication into the sdk_config.ini file, and use all the examples and your programs and as you have them, or you can use the Robot object with setting the escape_pod parameter to True, and passing the robot's ip address:

```
    with anki_vector.Robot(ip="192.168.0.148", escape_pod=True) as robot:
        robot.behavior.say_text("Hello Escape Pod")
```

### Documentation

You can generate a local copy of the SDK documetation by
