Description: cmeson is a TUI for [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) build system and offers a convenient, graphical way to configure build options instead of having to memorize them by heart and type them out in the terminal. The name and functionality of this application are derived from a similar application for [cmake](https://cmake.org/) ccmake. Anyway, a picture is worth a thousand words, so take a look at the image below.

        # Installation
        
        TODO
        
        # Usage
        
        	cmeson builddir
        	cmeson [OPTIONS] builddir [sourcedir] [TRAILING]
        
        	OPTIONS
        		-h, --help               Show help message and exit
        		--backend BACKEND        Select backend to query build options for
        
        *sourcedir* is a directory containing meson.build file and *builddir* is the build directory for the project. *sourcedir* is only needed for projects for which *meson setup* has not been run yet and defaults to the current working directory if not specified.
        
        The *--backend* option determined the list of options in the backend section and defaults to ninja. If you specify the backend using this option, you must not change the backend in TUI, as this will result in an error from meson. See the meson documentation for a complete list of supported backends.
        
        If any trailing options are given, they are passed as-is to meson and are not interpreted by this application. Normally you do not need to specify any trailing options, as most of them can be configured directly through TUI.
        
        # Todo
        
        This application is already in a fully usable state, but there are still some small things missing:
        
        - Write a man-page
        - Tests
        - grep -r -i TODO .
