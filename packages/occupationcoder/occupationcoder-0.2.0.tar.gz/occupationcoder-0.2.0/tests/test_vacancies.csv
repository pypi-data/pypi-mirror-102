Our research agenda is designed to address the fundamental issues facing central banks today, and we offer a unique experience for researchers interested in these questions as we house monetary, macroprudential, and microprudential policy functions under one roof. We are looking for PhD students who are enthusiastic about contributing to our research agenda, and to help shape the Bank's policies in the years ahead.As a PhD intern, you will have the opportunity to work on a research project with Bank of England economists from one of a variety of divisions, spanning monetary analysis, financial stability, international economics, prudential policy, supervision, risk management, and financial markets. You will work on a research topic of live interest to the Bank. While your exact research topic will be at the discretion of the Bank, we will seek to involve you in its design. Internships typically last for 12 weeks. And although most interns come to the Bank over the summer, we are flexible about the timing of the internship.You should be expecting to submit your PhD thesis within the next two years and be able to submit a recent research paper for our consideration (substantial work in progress is acceptable).All fields are considered, but we are particularly interested in candidates who have the technical skills and academic background to effectively contribute to research in the following areas:Monetary economics;Macroprudential framework, policy instruments within and beyond the banking sector and their transmission mechanism;Open-economy macroeconomics and international finance;Financial economics, including banking theory and regulation, risk modelling and management, stress testing, macro-finance, and asset pricing;Supervisory indicators, decision-making and communication, and the interaction with firms and their culture and behaviour;Applied econometrics and big data analysis, including text-based analysis, use of large micro datasets, and regulatory data;Technological and structural change in money, banking and financial markets.We are also keen to foster cross-disciplinary approaches and would welcome applications from students pursuing a PhD in relevant disciplines other than economics and finance.Please note that all appointments are subject to security clearance and immigration clearance.We offer a daily rate of ’ÇÎ£100 per day and pro rata holiday entitlement, based on 25 days per annum. Candidates who do not live in London will also receive an accommodation allowance of ’ÇÎ£100 per week during their stay.
