Description: # memtrace2npz
        
        This project is a utility for converting the output of DynamoRIO's memtrace-x86 client to an npz file. The output can be compressed into a zip file as well. 
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip3 install memtrace2npz
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        memtrace2npz < -i inputfile > [ -o outfile ] [ -h ] [ -f ]
        ```
        
        You must specifiy the input file with `-i`. You may optionally specify an outputfile -- if you don't, the output file will be in the current directory with the basename of your input file, and with the extension changed to `.npz`.
        
        You may skip the check for the existence of the outfile with `-f`. 
        
        ## Testing
        
        ```
        pytest
        ```
