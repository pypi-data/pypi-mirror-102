def fits_dataclass(cls):
    """
    A specification of the builtin `dataclasses.dataclass` that allows for simple, terse definitions of FITS-header-based
    dataclasses. When writing a DKIST metadataclass the developer specifies the desired class properties with values
    corresponding to their source keyword in a FITS header. This function creates an __init__ that populates the
    dataclass properties with the correct values and the numpy array.

    For IDE support the developer must specify the correct type of the desired value.

    Examples
    --------
    # Define a simple class
    @fits_dataclass
    class MetaData:
        elevation: float = 'TELEVATN'

    # Use it to ingest a header
    MD = MetaData(data, header)
    # Then access the elevation property
    some_number = MD.elevation / 2

    # subclassing the resulting dataclasses is possible and encouraged:
    @fits_dataclass
    class InstMetaData(MetaData):
        current_spatial_step: int = 'INST_011'
        # You also get all the keys defined in the subclass for free
    """
    # Note for future self: We need this custom decorator because of how @dataclass handles subclasses. Tl;dr: we _could_
    # put this code directly as __init__ in CommonFitsData and just use the @dataclass decorator but then any subclasses
    # would need to use @dataclass(init=False) in order have access to the parent's __init__ function. This works, but
    # puts more burden on definers of child classes to not mess it up. Also, we're already abusing the idea of what a
    # @dataclass is by using the "class variables" to define a mapping, not the actual properties. I think both of these
    # reasons are strong arguments for using a custom decorator, even if technically this is possible in a different way
    # with less code.
