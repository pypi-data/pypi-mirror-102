# rmsfact

A port of the R package [`rmsfact`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmsfact) by Dirk Edelbuettel.

Display a randomly selected quote about Richard M. Stallman based on the collection in the 'GNU
Octave' function 'fact()' which was aggregated by Jordi Guti√©rrez Hermoso based on the (now defunct)
site stallmanfacts.com (which is accessible only via <http://archive.org>).

# Usage

The package contains a single class, `RMSFact()` which provides a single method `rmsfact()` which
takes no arguments and prints a randomly-selected "fact" to the console.

```python
import rmsfact

factory = rmsfact.RMSFact()

factory.rmsfact()
```
