# rmsfact

A port of the R package [`rmsfact`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmsfact) by Dirk Edelbuettel.

Display a randomly selected quote about Richard M. Stallman based on the collection in the 'GNU
Octave' function 'fact()' which was aggregated by Jordi Guti√©rrez Hermoso based on the (now defunct)
site stallmanfacts.com (which is accessible only via <http://archive.org>).


# Installation

``` python
pip install rmsfact
```


# Usage

The package exports a single function `rmsfact()` which returns a single randomly-chosen "fact" as
a `str`.

```python
import rmsfact

rmsfact.rmsfact()
```

You can also run `python -m rmsfact` from a shell.


# Building from source

In the event you want to build the package from source, clone the repository...

```
git clone https://github.com/lewinfox/rmsfact.git
```

... `cd` into the project directory...

```
cd rmsfact
```

...and install with `make`

```
make install
```

This builds the package and then runs `python -m pip install .`


# Making changes

To add a new fact you can edit `rmsfact/data/rmsfact.txt`.

```
echo "A new fact" >> rmsfact/data/rmsfact.txt
```

The `Makefile` provides a couple of useful targets, one of which is `make build_binary_data` which
executes the script `rmsfact/data/build_rms_fact.py` to convert `rmsfact/data/rmsfact.txt` into a
`.dat` file using `pickle`. This `.dat` file is then read when the package is loaded.

Executing `make build` will rebuild the data file and produce the source and binary packages under
a `dist/` directory. You may need to `python -m pip install build` first.

```
make build
```

## Other makefile targets

* `make install_dev`: Install with `pip -e`
