# superfasthash
 
**Cython** port of vperron's [python-superfasthash](https://github.com/vperron/python-superfasthash) which is originally based on Paul Hsieh's [SuperFastHash algorithm](http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/hash.html).

* Fast as hell: Way faster than the original pure-python implementation.
* Dependency-agnostic: no python dependency whatsoever
* As minimal as possible.

This is just a 1:1 cython port; there are no tests. Push requests are welcomed.
